When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

It should be helpful when I want to collaborate with others so they contribute to my work
by using my remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic pulls might bring some unwanted problem into your branch. So pull changes manually
would be always safe.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Branches can be used for your own experiment on your local repository. Clones can be used to start your project
from other's repository such as a boilerplate code. Also, clones can be used along with forks which is similar to
to clones that copy someone's repository to your local repository. Difference is that forks copy the codes to your
github remote not to your local repository. Forks can be used for collaboration with other people while keeping your
own repository on both your local machine and remote to share your codes with other collaborators.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
